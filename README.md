# Classic Mini DIY Archive

This repository contains all of the markdown files used by Nuxt Content to generate the archive section on Classic Mini DIY's main website.

> Note: You must also update the [content.config.ts](https://github.com/Classic-Mini-DIY/classicminidiy/blob/main/content.config.ts) in the main repo as well when creating new collections

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store and manage the content for the archive section, ensuring that all information is organized and easily accessible. Without muddying the main website repository with content, this repository allows for easy updates and contributions to the archive section.

## Structure

The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and updates to the content. Each markdown file corresponds to a specific article or piece of content on the website. Please note that the folder and file structure align to the paths generated on the website.

```plaintext
Example:

content/archive/manuals/ADK1152.md

translates to

https://classicminidiy.com/archive/manuals/ADK1152

```

## Usage

To contribute or make changes to the content, simply edit or create the relevant markdown files and submit a pull request. All changes will be reviewed and merged accordingly.
